                <h1>The Adoption Process</h1>
                <p>At Pawfect Pawtrails, we strive to make the pet adoption process as smooth and rewarding as possible. Follow these steps to find your new furry family member!</p>
                
                <h2>1. View Available Pets</h2>
                <p>Start by browsing our online pet listings or attending one of our adoption events. Our adoptable pets' profiles include photos, descriptions, age, and other important details. Feel free to ask our staff any questions!</p>
                
                <h2>2. Submit an Application</h2>
                <p>Once you've found a potential match, complete an online adoption application. This helps us learn about your lifestyle and experience to ensure a great fit. You'll need to provide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal information</li>
                    <li>Residential details</li>
                    <li>Veterinarian information (if applicable)</li>
                    <li>Pet history and experience</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>3. Screening Process</h2>
                <p>Our adoption counselors will review your application and may reach out for additional information. We perform background checks, home visits (when possible), and vet reference checks as part of the screening process.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Meet and Greet</h2>
                <p>If your application is approved, we'll schedule a meet-and-greet session so you can interact with the pet in person at our facility or their foster home. This is an important step to ensure you both make a pawsitive connection!</p>
                
                <h2>5. Finalize the Adoption</h2>
                <p>After a successful meet-and-greet, you'll sign the official adoption paperwork, pay the adoption fee, and go over important information about your new pet's care, medical records, and any specific needs.</p>
                
                <h2>6. Bring Your New Pet Home!</h2>
                <p>Congratulations! Once all the paperwork is complete, you'll be able to take your new furry friend home. We'll provide you with helpful resources for pet supplies, training tips, and veterinary care recommendations.</p>
                
                <p>Throughout the adoption journey, our staff and volunteers are here to answer your questions and provide guidance. We want every adoption to be a perfect match!</p>
