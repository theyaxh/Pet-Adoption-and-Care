                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                
                <h2>How do I adopt a pet?</h2>
                <p>The adoption process starts by filling out an online application on our website. One of our adoption counselors will then get in touch to discuss your lifestyle and preferences to ensure a good match. If approved, you'll be able to meet potential pets at one of our adoption events or through a foster family visit.</p>
                
                <h2>What fees are involved in adoption?</h2>
                <p>Our adoption fees help cover vaccinations, spaying/neutering, microchipping and other medical expenses for the pets in our care. Fees range from $75-$200 for dogs and $50-$125 for cats, depending on age and any special needs.</p>
                
                <h2>Can I meet a pet before adopting?</h2>
                <p>Absolutely! We encourage all potential adopters to spend time with prospective pets through meet-and-greet sessions at our facility or with the pet's foster family. This allows you to make sure it's a perfect match before finalizing the adoption.</p>
                
                <h2>Do you accept pet surrenders?</h2>
                <p>Yes, if you can no longer care for your pet, we accept owner surrenders based on availability in our foster network. Please contact us to discuss your situation and start the intake process.</p>
                
                <h2>How can I become a foster home?</h2>
                <p>Fostering is a wonderful way to help rescue pets! We provide all supplies and cover medical costs for foster pets. You just need to complete a foster application, attend an orientation session, and open your home temporarily until the pet finds their forever family.</p>
                
                <h2>What kinds of pets do you have available?</h2>
                <p>We rescue and adopt out dogs and cats of all ages, sizes and breeds. Check our website frequently for updated listings of available pets.</p>
                
                <h2>Can I volunteer if I can't adopt right now?</h2>
                <p>Definitely! Volunteers are the backbone of Pawfect Pawtrails. We rely on volunteers to assist with adoption events, fundraisers, fostering, transportation and many other roles. Visit our volunteer page to see current opportunities.</p>
